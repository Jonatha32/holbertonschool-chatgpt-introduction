## Debugging Exercises

Here are some suggested exercises to practice with ChatGPT:

1. What would happen if you run `factorial.py` without any arguments? How would you fix it?
2. How would you modify `factorial.py` to handle negative numbers?
3. How would you enhance `print_arguments.py` to display the argument position along with its value?
4. Can you modify `change_background.html` to also display the hex code of the current background color?

Use these examples to practice formulating clear questions for ChatGPT and to understand how AI can assist in the debugging process.
